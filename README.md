# Cats-and-Dogs-Kaggle-Problem
Implementation of the famous [Cats and Dogs  classification problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition). 

## Getting Started
The complete description of the problem can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition).
### Requirements
I am writing my implementation using Keras library(with Tensorflow backend). Requirements are as follows:
  * tensorflow
  * keras
  * jupyter notebook
  
You must install each one of the above inorder to run this script on your computer. See [here](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/14/installing-keras-with-tensorflow-backend/) for some help. Its suggested to install tensorflow with GPU support. If you have a NVIDIA GPU, you may look [here](http://www.nvidia.com/object/gpu-accelerated-applications-tensorflow-installation.html) for some help.
